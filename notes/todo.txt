TTS
    Basic = Davis voice at regular speed all the time.
    Basic+ = Customize Voice and speed and Emotion. But constant on each one. 
    Advanced = take in output text, run that through gpt3.5 and ask to generate script. 
        the script can then be put back into speech sdk, making a TTS where emotions are not constant
        example before: Hello there! My name is Bob. I HATE APPLES. 
        example after: <excited> Hello There! <excited> My name is Bob. <angry><loud> I HATE APPLES <loud><angry>

Video
    Basic = Input video, use gpt4 and azure ai to analyze it. Standard Azure Ai studio code. 
    Basic+ = test it to work on large videos.
